        Welcome to the webpage. 
        I just left my job at Torch Technologies on 8 August 2025 as a Data Scientist to go back to school full time.
        I will be enrolled in Quantum Mechanics I (Physics 451), Optics and Waves (with lab), and CO300, Composition.

        While at Torch Technologies, I accomplished the following:

    <ul>
        <li>
        I deployed a 1D Convolutional Neural Network in production which had a 92% validation accuracy score.
        I streamed the data, put the full messages into a queue, and then parsed and performed inference on the
        complete messages before sending them to the database.
        </li>
        I built a web scraping program to get real time data 
        and perform orbital mechanics transformations to be in a for that is usable for the customer.
        <li>
        I packaged a set of python modules that my office used on a daily basis for
        calculating orbital mechanics transformations.
        </li>
        <li>
        I deployed two other data pipelines (one which involed binary parsing and the other xml parsing)
        so that the office could train and deploy future models.
        </li>
    </ul>
